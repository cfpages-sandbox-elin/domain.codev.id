## Features

*   **Secure User Accounts:** Sign in with your Google account to keep your domain list private and synced.
*   **Resilient Real-Time Domain Check:** Quickly see if a domain is available using a tiered approach with multiple fallbacks including WhoisXMLAPI, apilayer.com, whoisfreaks.com, and whoapi.com.
*   **Automated Daily Checks:** A secure, server-side Supabase Edge Function runs daily to automatically update the status of your tracked domains, checking for expirations and drops.
*   **Manual Re-check:** For any domain where the lookup failed, a simple "Re-check" button allows you to instantly try again.
*   **Direct Purchase Links:** For available domains, get quick links to recommended registrars to purchase the domain immediately.

## Getting Started: Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer) installed.

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add the required variables for Supabase and the WHOIS APIs. You will need to get these keys from their respective services.

    ```env
    # Supabase Credentials (Required)
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

    # WHOIS API Keys (Add at least one provider for full functionality)
    VITE_WHOIS_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOISXMLAPI_KEY
    VITE_APILAYER_API_KEY=YOUR_APILAYER_KEY
    VITE_WHOISFREAKS_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOISFREAKS_KEY
    VITE_WHOAPI_COM_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOAPI_COM_KEY
    
    # Optional: Self-hosted who-dat instance for WHOIS lookups
    # The public instance is not recommended due to rate limits and CORS issues.
    # See /docs/who-dat.md for deployment instructions.
    # VITE_WHO_DAT_URL=https://your-who-dat-instance.vercel.app
    # VITE_WHO_DAT_AUTH_KEY=YOUR_WHO_DAT_SECRET_KEY
    ```

    **Note:** The `VITE_` prefix is required for Vite to expose these variables to the application.

### Step 4: Set Up the Database Table

(Instructions for this step are unchanged and can be found in the original `README.md`)
```sql
-- Create custom types for cleaner constraints
CREATE TYPE public.domain_tag_type AS ENUM ('mine', 'to-snatch');
CREATE TYPE public.domain_status_type AS ENUM ('available', 'registered', 'expired', 'dropped', 'unknown');

-- Create the 'domains' table
CREATE TABLE public.domains (
    id bigint NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    user_id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT auth.uid(),
    domain_name text NOT NULL,
    tag public.domain_tag_type NOT NULL,
    status public.domain_status_type NOT NULL,
    expiration_date timestamptz NULL,
    registered_date timestamptz NULL,
    registrar text NULL,
    created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    last_checked timestamptz NULL,
    CONSTRAINT domains_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
    CONSTRAINT domains_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES auth.users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT domains_user_id_domain_name_key UNIQUE (user_id, domain_name)
);

-- Add comments to columns for clarity in the Supabase UI
COMMENT ON TABLE public.domains IS 'Stores domains tracked by users.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.id IS 'Primary key for the domain entry.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.user_id IS 'Foreign key linking to the user who owns this entry.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.domain_name IS 'The domain name being tracked.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.tag IS 'User-defined tag: "mine" or "to-snatch".';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.status IS 'Current status of the domain.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.expiration_date IS 'The expiration date of the domain.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.registered_date IS 'The registration date of the domain.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.registrar IS 'The registrar of the domain.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.last_checked IS 'Timestamp of the last successful WHOIS check.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.domains.created_at IS 'Timestamp when the domain was added to the tracker.';

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the table
ALTER TABLE public.domains ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies
-- 1. Users can see their own domains
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view their own domains"
ON public.domains
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 2. Users can insert new domains for themselves
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to insert their own domains"
ON public.domains
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 3. Users can update their own domains
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own domains"
ON public.domains
FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 4. Users can delete their own domains
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own domains"
ON public.domains
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 5: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Setting Up Automated Domain Checks

To enable automatic daily checks, you need to deploy and schedule the `check-domains` Supabase Edge Function. This is a crucial step for the app's core functionality.

### 1. Install, Link, and Set Secrets (Common First Step)

First, install the Supabase CLI, link it to your project, and set the required secrets.

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install supabase --save-dev

# Log in to your Supabase account
npx supabase login

# Link your local project to your remote Supabase project
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
```

#### Set Secrets for the Edge Function
The Edge Function needs API keys to work. It also needs a secret key to prevent unauthorized execution.

1.  **Create a Cron Secret:** Generate a strong, random string (e.g., using a password generator). This key will authorize the cron job service to run your function, protecting it from public access.

2.  **Set the Secrets:** Run these commands in your terminal, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys and the secret you just generated.

    ```bash
    # Required: Secret to authorize the cron job
    npx supabase secrets set CRON_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_STRING_HERE

    # Required: WHOIS API Keys (add at least one)
    npx supabase secrets set VITE_WHOIS_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOISXMLAPI_KEY
    npx supabase secrets set VITE_APILAYER_API_KEY=YOUR_APILAYER_KEY
    npx supabase secrets set VITE_WHOISFREAKS_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOISFREAKS_KEY
    npx supabase secrets set VITE_WHOAPI_COM_API_KEY=YOUR_WHOAPI_COM_KEY

    # Optional: Set these if you are using a self-hosted who-dat instance
    # npx supabase secrets set VITE_WHO_DAT_URL=https://your-who-dat-instance.vercel.app
    # npx supabase secrets set VITE_WHO_DAT_AUTH_KEY=YOUR_WHO_DAT_SECRET_KEY
    ```

### 2. Deploy the Edge Function

Deploy the `check-domains` function included in this project.

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy check-domains
```

After deploying, choose **one** of the following methods to schedule the job.

### Option 1: Using Supabase's Built-in Scheduler (Simple)

This is the easiest method and is great for most use cases.

1.  Navigate to your project on the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).
2.  Go to **Edge Functions** in the left sidebar.
3.  Click on the **`check-domains`** function.
4.  You'll see a command to invoke the function with `curl`. It includes the necessary `Authorization` header with your `service_role` key. You can use this to trigger it, but for scheduled jobs, Supabase handles auth internally.
5.  In the function's details page, find the **"Invoke on a schedule"** section.
6.  Enter a **Name** for your job, like `Daily Domain Check`.
7.  In the **"Cron schedule"** input, paste `0 0 * * *` to run the job daily at midnight (UTC).
8.  Click **Create schedule**.

### Option 2: Using an External Cron Service (e.g., fastcron.com)

This method provides more advanced features like detailed logs and failure notifications.

1.  **Sign up for a cron service:** Create an account on a service like [fastcron.com](https://fastcron.com/).

2.  **Get your Edge Function URL:**
    *   In your Supabase Dashboard, go to **Edge Functions** and click on the `check-domains` function.
    *   Under "Invoke via", find and copy the **POST** URL. It will look like `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-domains`.

3.  **Create a Cron Job in FastCron:**
    *   Log into your FastCron dashboard and click **"Add a cronjob"**.
    *   Fill out the form using the screenshots below as a guide:
        *   **URL to call**: Paste your Edge Function URL here.
        *   **When to call**: Select "Once a day" or enter `0 0 * * *` in the **Expression** field to run at midnight UTC.
        *   Expand the **"Send HTTP request"** section. **This is the most important step.**
        *   In the **HTTP headers** text area, add the following line, replacing `YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_STRING_HERE` with the `CRON_SECRET` you created earlier:
            ```
            Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_STRING_HERE
            ```
        *   **HTTP Method**: Can be left as `GET` or changed to `POST`.
    *   Configure other settings like timeout and notifications to your liking.
    *   Click **Save change**.

Your application is now fully configured to automatically monitor your domains every day.
